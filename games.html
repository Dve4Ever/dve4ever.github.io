               <p>Hello, Welcome to Devoooo, if I sound familiar, then its because I previously had a website at "devoooo.weebly.com" but that one has sadly been taken down. This is my new website, so tell all your friends that. This website took HOURS and HOURS to make, that's the new info but let's get to the point! I am a small YouTuber with about 450 subscribers and this is my website. This is mostly a gaming site, that was mostly created in my free time at school, but then the site started growing. I first used bots to get it popular but then I realized that I shouldn't use bots. So I tried to put this into the Bing and Google Search Consoles, and that helped a lot. I then realized that it started to grow my website to about 500 views a week and I noticed about 200 of them actually stay and play the games! I was excited to see these results. Once it got popular, I wanted to change things up a little bit and the layout is completely different. So a few months ago I made a video on this website and it got a ton of support, I also set up donations so I can make the website better because so I can have a shorter domain to help you guys out. I would love your support on this new website because I need it to grow like the outstanding support on my old website. The aim of this page (/games.html) is to provide you with free flash or html5 games that you can play any time, whether its at school when you are not supposed to (I highly recommend not to though). You can even play them at home if you like to play flash games at home. We also have a contact form on the home page, where you can suggest new games I should add or anything you think I should improve. I would love for you guys to leave comments on what I should do. If you would like to help out, you can email me short game descriptions or controls to help me out, I'll even give you a free shoutout, so what's wrong? What are you waiting for? Stay Devoooo!</p>
